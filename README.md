SolarWindsOrionREST
===================

# OVERVIEW

SolarWinds Orion REST is a python library that provides easy access to the SolarWinds Orion database, through a series of python modules. The library simplifies things by hiding both the REST syntax and SQL query language.

Just download the library, run your favourite python 2.7.x interpreter, import the library, and starting pulling down your Orion data.

This version of the library, provides access to about 50% of the NPM database tables. If you need others let us know as its easy to add more through an automated helper module that automatically generates the library. 

Check the GitHub wiki for detailed instructions.
